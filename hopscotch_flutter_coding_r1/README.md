# hopscotch_flutter_coding_r1

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Use commands to build and run the app

flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
flutter test --coverage
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/html
flutter run


it can be modularized further but not required as this is a small project and code is not messy..

specially widget can be taken out from screens but i have not done it because as of now this project is good...
